# Basics about the CLMS API

The CLMS Portal API is based on Plone's REST API. [Plone](https://plone.org) is the CMS on top of which
the CLMS Portal is built on and its REST API provides great number of features to access and interact
with the portal.

The full documentation about Plone's REST API can be found online [at Read the Docs](https://plonerestapi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
and we will be summarizing the most important features that we will be using to interact with the portal
here.

## URL of the API

If the base URL of the portal is `https://clms.copernicus.eu/` then the API is available at `https://clms.copernicus.eu/api/`.
